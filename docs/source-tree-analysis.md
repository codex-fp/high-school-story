## Entry Points

- `core/src/main/kotlin/pro/piechowski/highschoolstory/Entrypoint.kt` defines
  `GameEntrypoint` and currently keeps `run()` as `TODO()`.
- `lwjgl3/src/main/kotlin/pro/piechowski/highschoolstory/game/lwjgl3/SandboxLauncher.kt`
  starts the current development sandbox.
- `lwjgl3/src/main/kotlin/pro/piechowski/highschoolstory/game/lwjgl3/MainLauncher.kt`
  is reserved for the eventual full game path.

## Build Structure

- `settings.gradle.kts` includes `:core`, `:lwjgl3`, and `includeBuild("./engine")`.
- Root `build.gradle.kts` applies shared Kotlin, Java, ktlint, KSP, repositories,
  toolchain, and asset-list generation settings.
- `core/build.gradle.kts` depends on KGE modules and game runtime libraries.
- `lwjgl3/build.gradle.kts` configures desktop backend, run working directory,
  packaging, and platform-specific jar tasks.

## Asset Organization

- `assets/maps/` contains `town.tmx`, `road.tmx`, map rules, and Tiled session
  files.
- `assets/tilesets/` contains tileset definitions.
- `assets/textures/character/` contains character sheets.
- `assets/textures/phone/` contains phone UI textures and atlas data.
- `assets/ui/skin/` contains the LibGDX skin JSON, atlas, and fonts used by
  `UserInterface` and Koin `Skin` binding.
